              <h4>Description: </h4>
              <p>This website was developed with the goals of collecting all of the different portfolio-level projects that I have created and am working on creating in the future all into one spot to aid in showcasing what I have learned so far and also my goals both in a career and for my hobbies. Additionally, this website was built completely without a base on purpose to show the creation a web-based project without a template to learn by exploring and creating more about the connection between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript at a deeper level.</p>

            <div class="wrap">
              <h4>Challenges and What Was Learned: </h4>
              <p>From doing this project individually but also as one of my first larger scale website building projects, it has taught me a lot more about more advanced levels of both coding through learning more features of HTML, being a refresher to CSS, and also expanding my knowledge of JavaScript and graphic design through element layout, color theory, and creating a digital prototype in Figma to levels beyond the knowledge that I previously had of only what I needed to create for my past classes. In terms of individual development, I am learning more about the deeper layers of website development without having guidelines but with the need to both discover my creativity and also figure out what to learn about those topics all in a timely and motivated manner.</p>

            <p>May 2025 to June 2025</p>

          <div class="wrap">
            <h4>Description: </h4>
            <p>This project was created as a part based on the need of how the website before had a majority of its webpages having out of date information and how it’s a website that is meant for over 500+ people each school year that are involved in the student leadership side of the student clubs. Additionally, the website also serves as the main resources for any University of Washington Tacoma club and is used for those in the community who are trying to learn more about the clubs and programs available at the University of Washington Tacoma.</p>

          <div class="wrap">
            <h4>Challenges and What Was Learned: </h4>
            <p>This was my first paid coding experience and doing it individually taught me how programming can work into a career, time management, and how to work with a client in this case as I was working with the Assistant Director for Student Involvement to make sure that the vision of the changes matched what I was creating and also to explore and implement new ideas that weren’t thought of before such as adding a page for when clubs reactivate. Additionally, I also learned how to receive and implement user feedback and critique into my code as I was making sure to ask from people who used the website frequently such as the Center for Student Involvement Front Desk and Professional Staff members and at the time current students who use the webpage to implement features such as links opening in new tabs and adding an updated full list of the active clubs.</p>

            <h4>Description: </h4>
            <p>This website was developed as an extra idea that I had and created with agreement and feedback from my team for the Grandmas vs. Unhappiness game to help provide more content to the players. Inspired by how information pages like Wikipedia showcase games and also by collectors’ artbooks, the goal of the Grandmas vs. Unhappiness is to provide more lore to the game that my team and I created.</p>

            <h4>Challenges and What Was Learned: </h4>
            <p>This was an individually developed project and I learned how to use GitHub Pages, creating a page within a markup environment, how to create Wikipedia-style pages, and how to manage time with the goals of the team. This project I received support from my team to work on this if I had time and there were moments where the page was developed while other projects were going on simultaneously but I was also able to receive reactions from my team to make sure that by creating a Wiki page, it holds everything we all wanted to showcase about the Grandmas vs. Unhappiness game but beyond what we had time to put in the game so the extras we had to scrap that had premade concepts and assets and also everyone’s ideas could be showcased.</p>

            <p>This website was designed to create a showcase of the club’s history and to show the present and future possibilities of the club’s possibilities.

            <p>The main thing learned was more so gaining a strong refresher on HTML coding but also how to use material icons and how to learn from everyone’s vast and different skillsets. Serving as a Co-Lead during the starting phase of the project while also doing multiple projects simultaneously all during a busier time of year taught me more about how to make sure that everyone has the resources that they need to contribute to the project while also finding a balance between many things happening simultaneously.</p>

  <h3>MixView Planner</h3>
  <div class="wrap">
    <h4>Duration: </h4>
    <span>September 2024 to December 2024</span>
  </div>
  <div class="wrap">
    <h4>Description: </h4>
    <p>To create an online planner that will be able to help users organize and create schedules that also show what we are learning about databases in the TCSS 445 Database Systems Design class. Our team’s target audience is anyone who needs or wants a program to help with scheduling their plans.</p>
  </div>
  <p>Main Features of MixView Planner:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Allows for each user to have their account.</li>
    <li>Choose different information to view within the planner.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Viewing all events, upcoming events, special events, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Users can add events as they have more plans to add.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="wrap">
    <h4>Technology Used:</h4>
    <p>SQL, JavaScript, HTML, Google Cloud Platform, VSCode</p>
  </div>
  <div class="wrap">
    <h4>Challenges and What Was Learned: </h4>
    <p>In this team project, we learned as a group how to utilize SQL and web development in designing a database from conceptual to a web-based application. Each of us was developing the database, creating queries, and also implementing the project into a website format and creating design formats such as an Entry-Relation (ER) Diagram, Relational Schema, and a Normalization Proof to show the relations of the attributes in our database that consisted of different event entries. Additionally, on a personal level, this project taught me how to build a web development-focused project but also how to work and create databases. Our main challenges were towards adapting our ideas based on time and complexity while keeping the original vision of MixView Planner in being applied which we learned throughout this project.</p>
  </div>
  <h4>Potential Future Work Enhancements/Features: </h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Giving users the ability to filter events by event type when viewing all events.</li>
    <li>Having an interactive calendar view based on a user’s imputed events along with having multiple views available.</li>
  </ul>
