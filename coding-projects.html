        <p>The following are some of my core projects that I have created through programming along with some of my current projects that I am developing in my free time.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="wrap">
            <h4>Description: </h4>
            <p> A 2D pixel art light story-driven rhythm game where you are an octopus trying to bring back joy that has been long lost to everyone by helping the aquatic creatures and even people who are in the aquarium as you go from area to area bringing music to with each area having a focus on a different type/genre of music.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="wrap">
            <h4>Technology Used: </h4>
            <span>Godot, GDScript, C#, Notion, MPCBeats, Musescore, GarageBand</span>
        </div>
        <div class="wrap">
            <h4>Challenges & What Was Learned: </h4>
            <p>While this project is in the early stages, currently the main challenge will be learning how to use Godot, how to create a rhythm game, and how to come up with the story of a game as an individual developer. Additionally, this project has the opportunity to expand my music composition and marketing abilities to help in hopefully creating a meaningful game and sharing it with the community.</p>

            <h4>Description:</h4>
            <p> A 2D Sci-Fi RPG and Visual Novel game where your goal is to explore the galaxy to save it from a new danger of mechatronics that appears 15 years after a society-changing natural disaster that drastically changed the lives of the protagonists and their party.</p>

            <h4>Technology Used: </h4>

        <div class="wrap">
            <h4>Challenges and What Was Learned: </h4>
            <p>The process has taught me how to create a large-scale project in a game engine and also a lot more about C# coding and asset creation. Additionally, with having a friend writing the story fully and Iâ€™m only doing brainstorming and script editing, I'm also learning a lot more about how to turn an idea into something in a program.</p>
