            <p>With this project, it will be an original music composition portfolio that can also recommend music based on aspects such as what project it was used in, instrument focuses, and the genre for example. There will be two builds to this project of one that uses React, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript and a handmade database and endpoints while the second build will be in Google Colab and Python and using AI to navigate through the data. My goal is to both use this project as a way to refine and grow my skills as a developer, to compare the performance of AI to human made code, and even to learn how to develop a framework for an idea that I have for a long-term project that I have here on this page of Melodies of a Hopeful Sunrise.</p>

            <p>While as October 29th, 2025 this project is in the early stages and worked on only in spare moments, some immediate challenges has been learning about the similarities and differences of different software options as this multiple software development approach is allowing me to explore more deeply into both software that I learned from past projects and software that I wanted to teach myself about.</p>

This project was created as a part of the TCSS 460: Client/Server Programming for Internet Applications to learn more about creating and implementing a program that has both a server connection and also how a client interacts with the website and that the server can be accessed safely to deliver the information that it needs to.</p>

            <h4>Description: </h4>
            <p>Fetchly is an app that was created in a team of 4 as a part of the UHackathon 2025 competition and is designed to help people find lost/misplaced items and find better places to store them to prevent misplacing them again. We implemented a cross-platform mobile app using React-native for the frontend, YOLOv8 Convolutional Neural Network for real-time object detection, and a Python Flask API to process images and return detected objects and empty zones. TypeScript for the routes and used Figma to prototype the UX/UI design. In this competition, we won first place in the Experimental project pipeline.</p>

        <div class="wrap">
            <h4>Problems Solved by the Project</h4>
            <p>The impact of this would be to help people organize their items by showing empty spaces to promote a habit of placing things in areas that are then easy to locate the item again. Additionally, our target audience is the elderly or people who are near-sighted, and using this app will help with locating items that are missing by using image detection, which is utilized by computer vision.</p>

        <div class="wrap">
            <h4 style="width: 2200px;">Challenges and What Was Learned: </h4>
            <p> Developing Fetchly has taught my entire team and I how to develop a mobile app, how to continuously learn and adapt especially when building a project in a small amount of time, and how to compete in a hackathon. On a personal level, I have learned about the nature of how it’s important to develop a project if it can help people even if some people to initially have the wrong impression of why you created that project since while the event because it was small-scale was planned for judging to be fully ethical way of everyone is on an equal playing field, anyone even those who worked on the event organization could compete, and with only judges and not competing volunteers only able to know the scores and ranking before the results became public, because my team somehow had good results from the judges to the point of winning a category, it led some people to have the wrong impression initially on our project though my team and I moved forward beyond that as our only focus was on what the project has the potential to do for the community and not on the competition ranking in which everyone was able to eventually see the focus of the project itself.</p>

    <h3>Image Edge Detection Techniques</h3>
    <div class="wrap">
        <h4>Duration: </h4>
        <span>January 2024 to March 2024</span>
    </div>
    <div class="wrap">
        <h4>Description: </h4>
        <p>In this research project, a peer and I worked on researching different image edge detection techniques with the science and math behind them to show how aspects such as Gaussian image blurring can be all-around techniques for image edge detection. The techniques focused on in the paper were of gradient and Gaussian image edge detection techniques through aspects such as convolution. This project was also a way to apply the concepts of Matrix Algebra into as a part of a TMATH 208 Matrix Algebra class.</p>

    <div class="wrap">
        <h4 style="width: 980px;">Challenges and What Was Learned: </h4>
        <p>The skills that I learned was about doing research that utilizes developing a program and applying theories and also improving skills in using software such as Jupyter Notebook, Python, and GitHub. The main thing was a challenge was finding the time to do the project as we both ended up having really busy schedules so we had to adapt huge components of this project while actively learning about the topics but we were able to finish the research, create a code example, and also create a research paper report for the project. </p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Past Coding Competitions</h2>
<p>The following are the past coding competitions that I have competed in up to currently: </p>

<h4>Puget Sound Programming Competition (PSPC) Winter 2025 (February 22nd, 2025)</h4>
<h4>2024 International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) Pacific Northwest Regional Contest - Division I (November 16th, 2024)</h4>
<ul>
    <li>For this competition, my team and I decided to compete in the harder division so we could gain experience in more appliactions of algorithms and programming concepts.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Puget Sound Programming Competition (PSPC) Spring 2024 (May 4th, 2024)</h4>
<ul>
    <li>In this competition, my team of 2 peers and I placed 3rd out of 21 teams.</li>
</ul>
<h4>2023 International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) Pacific Northwest Regional Contest - Division II (February 24th, 2024)</h4>
<h4>Puget Sound Programming Competition (PSPC) Autumn 2023 (October 28th, 2023)</h4>
<p>For the focus of the Puget Sound Programming Competitions (PSPC), it is a programming contest where students from the Puget Sound area form teams of three to solve a series of programming problems in varying difficulty in a four-hour window with focuses on aspects such as working in a team and building up various aspects from programming skills to even a focus on networking and the community.</p>
<p>For the focus of the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC), it is a programming contest that has teams of three where you are solving problems and creating solutions while focusing on real-world applications and algorithm design to develop efficient and unqiue solutions while working together as a team.</p>
