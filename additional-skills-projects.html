        <p>The following are projects that I have created that encompass skills other than the focus on portfolios with projects such as robotics, music composition, program development, writing editing, and technical writing.</p>

                <p>Initially starting as the student representative at the start of the committee to now being a recently graduated and UWT alumni committee member and with current goals that the committee has decided on that I will come back to SET as a paid mentor through the program. I have both created opportunities for the committee to gain insight from people involved with the video game industry such as game developers and also attended interviews and meetings that have discussed the core focuses that the prospective program wants to achieve while also making sure to add focuses from the student body as well.</p>

            <div class="wrap">
                <h4>Challenges and What Was Learned: </h4>
                <p>The main things that I have learned so far are how programs are created but also about how higher academia works and what itâ€™s like to collaborate on a team of working with those who have taught and mentored. Additionally, this project so far has expanded both my networking capabilities and creativity in project planning as it has had a lot of communication within the community to help in gaining the insight to make a strong and effective program.</p>

                <p>In this project, I learned how to turn fragments of melodic ideas into music along with what parts of music composition I should learn more about in the future such as chord progressions and advanced music theory to help in continuously improving my music composition skills over time as a hobby. Additionally, I learned how to use skills that I already have while simultaneously learning new skills in a limited amount of time such as recording a song idea on the clarinet and then taking an hour to transpose the music onto sheet music and develop the melodic fragment to be a full song.</p>
