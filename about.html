        <p>My name is Kylie Hammett and I aspire to pursue a game design and web/software development career path.</p>
        <p>For my education, I started college in September 2022 and graduated in June 2025 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Systems (3.63 Cumulative GPA) from the University of Washington Tacoma. I pursued going to college immediately after graduating high school in June 2022 from Bethel High School and completed the Cambridge program which allowed me to achieve my Computer Science degree in only 3 years.</p> 
        <p>My current strengths are in full-stack with a focus on frontend coding, Java, HTML, CSS, SQL, and R but I also have strengths in areas such as project development, agile methodologies, problem solving, and team collaboration. I’m always curious and willing to learn and I always go into every effort with kindness, calmness, working as hard as I can, and both encourage and support everyone along with that in group projects, everyone's ideas are heard, all while always making sure in any project, individual or group, that all objectives and goals can be accomplished.</p>
        <p>As for the reason why I want to pursue a career in game design and web/software development, it starts from how video games are a main reason that I became passionate for computer science and the technology industry as they taught me from both society and my own experiences that software can be used to help people in a myriad of different ways while creating memorable and good software that can help the world. Whether it is through software that can provide people assistance to make their lives easier and websites that can help them discover information that can help them reach their aspirations to developing innovative software that might have once only been in imagination or to develop a game that showcases an emotionally thought provoking story.</p>
