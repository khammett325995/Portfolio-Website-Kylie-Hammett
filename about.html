        <p>My name is Kylie Hammett and I aspire to pursue a game design and web/software development career path.</p>
        <p>For my education background, I started college in September 2022 and graduated in June 2025 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Systems (3.63 Cumulative GPA) from the University of Washington Tacoma. I pursued going to college immediately after graduating high school in June 2022 from Bethel High School and completed the Cambridge program which allowed me to achieve my Computer Science degree in only 3 years.</p> 
        <p>My current strengths are in full-stack with a focus on frontend coding, Java, HTML, JavaScript, SQL, C, and R and I have strengths in project development, agile methodologies, problem solving, and team collaboration. Iâ€™m always curious and willing to learn and I always go into every effort with kindness, calmness, and both encourage and support peers in team collaboration while also always working as hard as I can to make sure that all objectives and goals can be accomplished.</p>
        <p>As for the reason why I want to pursue a career in game design and web/software development, However, for me at least, video games are a main reason that I became passionate for computer science and the technology industry as they taught me from an early age both from society and my own experiences that they can be used to help people in a lot of different ways while creating memorable and good experiences for so many people. Whether it is through software that can provide people assistance to make their daily lives easier and websites that can help them discover information that can help them reach their aspirations to exciting and innovative gameplay mechanics that might have once only been in imagination previously or to develop a game that showcases an emotionally thought provoking story. That realization of how much good that technology can create to the world definitely has been a motivating factor in my life and what I aspire to do as a career of creating and collaborating with others to create software (hopefully with video games but even generally speaking from apps and programs to websites) that can positively impact the lives of others.</p>
