            <h3>Registered Student Organizations (RSO) Coordinator for Promotions and Partnerships</h3>
        <div class="wrap">
            <h4>Duration:</h4>
            <span>September 2023 to June 2025</span>
        </div>
            <h4>Description: </h4>
            <p>The Registered Student Organization (RSO) Student Coordinator is an important member of a dynamic team that works in the Center for Student Involvement and Division of Student Affairs. The RSO Student Coordinator serves as a point-of-contact for UW Tacoma’s 50+ student clubs and organizations, assisting them in their endeavors and providing resources, guidance, and training/workshops for their development and growth. The position supports all RSO efforts, projects, and processes alongside the Assistant Director for Student Involvement. The Registered Student Organization (RSO) Coordinator for Promotions and Partnerships will have particular responsibilities within their position to connect with Registered Student Organizations, as well as develop and maintain a system of communication with the organization and their leaders. The RSO Coordinator for Promotions & Partnerships will join the efforts of the overall RSO Coordinator Team, including the Assistant Director for Student Involvement and the RSO Coordinator for Events & Projects to support overall RSO initiatives and projects together.</p>
        <h4>Committees Joined Through the RSO Coordinator Position: </h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>2024-2025 University of Washington Tacoma Council for Campus Engagement (CCE)</b>: The Council for Campus Engagement is a committee comprised of UW Tacoma students, meets regularly to discuss and review proposals for the Campus Event Fund (CEF) and the Conference and Training Fund (CTF). The Campus Event Fund and the Conference and Training Fund provide students with resources to put on homegrown events on campus and pursue professional development opportunities outside of the classroom or campus employment. </li>
            <li><b>2024-2025 & 2023-2024 Co-Chair of the Associated Students of the University of Washington Tacoma (ASUWT) Registered Student Organizations (RSO) Committee</b>: Created during the 2023-2024 school year, the RSO committee is committed to fostering an inclusive environment where student organizations can access support resources, engage in student advocacy, and find partnership opportunities. We hope to empower RSOs to support campus life and the broader campus community. ASUWT recognizes that Registered Student Organizations (RSOs) are the lifeforce of the UW Tacoma campus. The RSO Committee serves as a dedicated platform where members of student organizations can openly discuss concerns, ask questions, and offer comments on how ASUWT can improve the student experience. In this committee, the ASUWT Director of Outreach and those who work in the RSO Coordinator position serve as Co-Chairs to the committee.</li>
            <li><b>2024-2025 University YMCA Advisory Council & 2023-2024 University and Tacoma Center YMCA Advisory Council Member</b>: The YMCA Advisory Council serves the community to help in ensuring that the YMCA resources and community both locally and with the University of Washington Tacoma is connected and helps with the YMCA’s annual campaign. In the 2024-2025 year, the YMCAs split into 2 separate Advisory Councils which is why the title has shifted.</li>
