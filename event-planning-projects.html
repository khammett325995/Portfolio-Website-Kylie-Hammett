            <p>Game Development Club at UWT is dedicated to the learning and teaching of video game development, both as a hobby and for entrance into the Video Game Industry.</p>
          </div>
            <h4>Involvement Description: </h4>
            <p>With this club, I served in multiple leadership roles and the club has had a focus on learning and teaching how to create game development and programming based projects. Specifically, the club learned and started creating original games in teams using the Unity and Godot game engines, the club created the Game Development Club at UWT club website from nothing, developed community game development workshops hosted by student members and club alumni, providing community game showcases and alpha-testing opportunities, and the club became leading members of reviving the annual UW Tri-Campus Game Jam and in creating UHackathon, an annual UWT-based hackathon. Additionally, the club has become more involved both through social media, creating both community events and guest speaker events with industry professionals, and tabling at multiple UWT events like Involvement Fairs and Block Party.</p>         
            <p>Some of the guest speaker events include people such as Eric Barone (ConcernedApe), Christian Tuttle (Imaginary Game Studios), Alison Czarnietzki (Only By Midnight Studios), and Jerry Vorhies. The alpha testing event was with the game Spellomancer (Hidden Variable Studios). As for the workshops that some of the club’s members hosted, they focused on topics such as Introduction to Game Design, Introduction to Pixel Art, Krita, Introduction and Sculpting in Blender.</p>
          <div class="wrap">
            <h4>Technology Used: </h4>
            <p>GitHub, Unity, itch.io, Canva, Discord, Instagram, LinkTree</p>
          </div>
          <div class="wrap">
            <h4>Challenges and What Was Learned: </h4>
            <p>I learned both technical skills from how to develop a game to more skills in using software such as Unity, Godot, Krita, and Blender and even programming languages such as Lua. Additionally, I also learned how to create opportunities as the club was starting with 4 members and has grown to 15 members and is now thriving as the main focuses were making sure that the club could be there for anyone while creating opportunities that can positively impact people’s lives and careers.</p>

            <p>With this club, I served in multiple leadership roles and the club has had a focus on learning and teaching how to create robotics, engineering, and electronics based projects and more recently I have been involved with the Xylophone Robot and Robobrawl projects and this year, the club was able to the club was able to have 5 people attend the 2025 IEEE Rising Stars Conference, created 2 team projects of building RC Cars from scratch, making sure that the UWT IEEE programs are active within IEEE’s Region 6 and Seattle Section programs, and helped grow UWT’s Branch of IEEE Power and Energy Society (PES) and has become more involved both through social media, creating both community events and guest speaker events with industry professionals, and tabling at multiple UWT events like Involvement Fairs and Block Party.</p>

            <h4>Challenges and What Was Learned: </h4>
            <p>In this club, I learned more about technical skills in circuits and robotics but also how to step out of my comfort zone to continuously learn new skills, how to create a funding proposal, and also how to take risks in order to create learning and community building opportunities. Additionally, I learned also about how to adapt as life happens or scenarios change to make sure that what I was doing were the right actions to take with the club in mind especially with the club growing from only 5 members to about 20 active members during my time in a President role since I made sure that opportunities could be created that would help people and the community first.</p>

            <h3>UHackathon 2025</h3> 
        <div class="wrap">
          <h4>Event Occured: </h4>
          <p>May 17th, 2025</p>
        </div>          
        <div class="wrap">
          <h4>Duration of Event Planning: </h4>
          <p>February 2025 to May 2025</p>
        </div>
        <h4>Description: </h4>
          <p>UHackathon—a dynamic 6-hour hackathon where teams of four will collaborate, create, and compete! Whether you're a coding pro or a first-time hacker, this is your chance to showcase your skills, solve real-world challenges, and connect with industry leaders.</p> 
<p>In this event, I was both a main co-lead to planning UHackathon and had the chance to compete. Some of the responsibilities included leading and attending meetings both with the UHackathon Planning Team of up to 20 members, a volunteer team of 7 people, and with up to 10 University of Washington Tacoma faculty members from various departments, developing a plan with the event leads on how UHackathon could happen between event logistics to community outreach and marketing. We especially made sure everything we did was ethical, can be used to create an annual hackathon, and could bring the entire community together with it being focused on the University of Washington Tacoma but also open to anyone as the event also bring accessibility to the community in experiencing a hackathon. Additionally, I also created and co-moderated for UHackathon 2025 the Discord server for all UHackathon events which has 100+ members and was started in March 2025.</p>
<p>UHackathon 2025 is the first hackathon at the University of Washington Tacoma since 2019 and is the largest as of May 2025 in the South Puget Sound area with nearly 100 competitors on the day.</p>

          <h4>Challenges and What Was Learned: </h4>
          <p>From this event, there was learning on how to create an event but also how to move forward when things seemed tough or when the odds were against as there were several points where the hackathon was almost canceled or significantly decreased but the team and I were able to create plans to ensure safety and balance for everyone. I also learned both as a lead in the event planning and due to the event being able to be judged by external judges, had the chance to learn also as a competitor as the hackathon about how a hackathon works in both similarities and differences to other community events and coding competitions.</p>
